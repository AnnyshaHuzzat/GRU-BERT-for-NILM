# GRU-BERT-for-NILM
This repository contains the implementation of GRU-BERT models for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), as presented in our published work. The models leverage a combination of  GRU layers and BERT-based embeddings to accurately predict household appliance energy consumption and ON/OFF states from aggregated smart meter readings.
