# GRU-BERT-for-NILM
This repository contains the implementation of GRU-BERT models for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), as presented in our published work. The models leverage a combination of  GRU layers and BERT-based embeddings to accurately predict household appliance energy consumption and ON/OFF states from aggregated smart meter readings.
# Datasets
The UK Domestic Appliance-Level ELECTRIcity [(UK-DALE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0284) dataset provides detailed energy usage data from five UK households, including both aggregate mains and individual appliance readings. We use low-frequency data for five appliances namely, refrigerator, washer-dryer, microwave, dishwasher, and kettle. All signals are resampled to six-second intervals with forward-filling applied for gaps under three minutes, ensuring temporal alignment between mains and appliance-level data.
The Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset [(REDD)](https://github.com/inesylla/energy-disaggregation-DL) is a benchmark NILM dataset widely used for evaluating appliance-level energy disaggregation. For the REDD dataset, we use the pre-processed data where thresholds and parameters are chosen based on experimental settings.
